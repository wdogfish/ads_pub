    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting is a fundamental data science task. Accurate forecasting is crucial when planning and allocating resources, setting goals and detecting anomalies. However, building reliable and robust forecasting models is challenging and often requires expert input. For example, there may be holidays or other 'one-off' effects that need to be taken in consideration for accurate forecasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this short tutorial we will provide an overview forecasting and discuss how to quickly implement your own forecast using the Prophet package recently released by Facebook Core Data Science team. The Prophet package fits an easily interpretable regression model which can account for seasonality trends (e.g., yearly or weekly effects) and holiday effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial we will be using an open access TFL dataset relating to the number of TFL cycles borrowed over a period of several years. This dataset will demonstrate considerable season effects (for example there are yearly seasonal effects as customers are likely to cycle in the summer) as well as and holiday effects (in particular, we will study the effects of bank holidays and the tube strike on the number of bikes borrowed!). This dataset will demonstrate considerable season effects (i.e., more likely to cycle in the summer) as well as trend and holiday effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the details of the prophet package, we provide an exploratory overview of the dataset."

    "## The Prophet model\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the prophet package is to decompose time series data into the following three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- trends: these are non-periodic and systematic trends in the data,\n",
    "- seasonal effects: these are modelled as daily or yearly periodicities in the data (optionally also hourly), and\n",
    "- holiday/one-off effects: these are effectively outliers.\n",
    " \n",
    "Each of these components contribute *additively* to the observed time series. In other words, the number of cycle hires on any give day is *the sum* of the trend component, the seasonal component and the one-off effects. As a result, the model can be mathematically written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \\epsilon_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y(t)$ is the number of cycles hired on day $t$ and $g(t), s(t)$ and $h(t)$ correspond to the growth trend, seasonal effects and holiday effects respectively. Finally, $\\epsilon_t$ accounts for noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "We note that the approach taken in the Prophet packge is different from traditional forecasting models such as [ARMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive%E2%80%93moving-average_model) models. For example, note that $y(t)$ is not a function of $y(t-1)$ but instead a function of the growth, season and holiday effects. The main advantages of taking an additive approach are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides us with more flexibility. For example, we can easily accomodate irregular measurements.\n",
    "- We can directly interpret each of the additive components and thus untangle the contributions of each aspect to the forecasts. This is important when we look to understand how the data was generated.\n",
    " \n",
    "We now discuss each of the components of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend component\n",
    "\n",
    "The default trend component in the Prophet package is a linear growth trend with some changepoints. If there are no changepoints, this means that the growth with continue to grow at some linear rate such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g(t) = \\alpha t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Changepoints are introduced so that the linear rate of growth can vary. For example, it may be the case that there was 2% daily growth (corresponding to $g(t) = 1.02 \\times t$) for the first year and 1% daily growth (so that $g(t) = 1.01 \\times t$) afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonal components\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonality is a crucial component of many time-series and is clearly present in the TFL data we study here. The approach taken in the Prophet package is to consider various seasonal components with varying periodicities. For example, we may have one component with a periodicity of 7 days to capture weekly effects, and another with a periodicity of 365 days to capture yearly effects. By default, the Prophet package includes weekly and yearly seasonalities. This is what makes the most sense in this example, but it is also possible to include other seasonalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Holidays/outliers \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a well-document difficulty with time-series and forecasting data is the presence of outliers. These are data points which deviate significantly from the distribution of the remainder of the data. If these points are ignored they may possibly lead to poor forecasts and so it is important to consider these points carefully. Recall that in the case of the TFL cycle hire data, there were clear outliers around the time of the 2015 strikes (around the summer of 2015). Other important examples may include holidays or snow days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prophet package directly allows for such events by allowing the user to input a list of days which were holidays or potential outliers. The holiday component to the model is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h(t) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\kappa & \\mbox{if $t$ is a holiday/outlier}\\\\\n",
    "0 & \\mbox{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way the scalar $\\kappa$ accounts for large positive/negative values of holidays or potential outliers."
